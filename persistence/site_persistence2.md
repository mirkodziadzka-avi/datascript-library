# Custom Site Persistence using Cookie - Solution B

Site Persistence can be achieved leveraging built-in Avi GSLB functionality, however there are use cases when external GSLB is used and site persistence required with Avi solution.

Solution B:
1. Cookie "site-cookie" is leveraged to define site persistence by allocating the cookie on new request that identify site specific information, site_cookie is defined as site_cookie = avi.vs.name() .. ":" .. avi.vs.ip() .. ":" .. avi.vs.port()
2. There are two pools has to be defined per site local_pool and proxy_pool:
   a. local_pool will be used to serve new requests locally or redirected requests from other sites based on decisions made at remote sites. local_pool includes actual servers.
   b. proxy_pool will be used to redirect requests to site defined in cookie or will be pool to handle request if there are no local pool members considered up. proxy_pool includes other sites Virtual Services IPs.
3. There are list of health checks built-in:
   a. to avoid redirecting request to site with no active servers in local_pool
   b. to avoid attaching cookie for local processing if there are no local_pool members up
   c. serve a maintenance page when both local and proxy pool don't have any members up.
4. Solution B is optimized based on server_persistence_cookie processing first, meaning if the local site receives request with already local server_persistence_cookie traffic will be processed locally or as site-cookie is not set. This done to minimize request processing time, where in Solution A site_cookie logic is always required to be executed.
5. Solution B is drafted for two sites scenario, where server persistence cookie is configured on local_pool using Avi API. The code can be minimized even more, considering two sites scenario, however in order to scale it later for 3-4 sites scenario - the site_cookie section kept the same as in Scenario A.
